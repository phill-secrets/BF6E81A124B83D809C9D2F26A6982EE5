*Question 1*: Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:

Records
Indexing
I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers, George

Hi George

Thank you for your question and trust you are having a great day.

As a starting point i would invite you to read how Algolia works - https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/ as it will give you a great high level overview of the platform.

You can find the following information about records here - https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/in-depth/what-is-in-a-record/

-Index snippet-
An index is a collection of records that you create as soon as you send records to Algolia. You can create several indices that contain different sets of objects. All indices live on Algolia’s servers.

Once you’ve pushed your data to Algolia, you can start thinking of how to organize your indices. This includes how many indices to have and how to configure each one. You can put all your records into a single index, or spread them across several indices. How you organize your indices depends on how you want to search and display your objects.

Finally regarding your question about Custom Ranking, lets set up a time to workshop your goals and data to see what the best solution might be.

If you have any questions please reach out.

*Question 2*: Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards, Matt
